      " Since I manage penetration testing in the company, I have to train our specialists in penetration testing from time to time to ensure that the quality of our results is high. I believe in the “learning by doing” principle, so I setup gamified labs, and capture-the-flag competitions. We then introduced Hack The Box Academy to the team. The team can now quickly learn by themselves through the theoretical and practical side of penetration testing with very in-depth and up-to-date materials without the need of requested labs or challenges to be built for them. As of now, to spice up the learning, we have a “Hacker of the Month” where we recognize the most progressive employee in our Hack The Box platform. ",

      " Hack The Box has been great for recruitment to quickly establish the caliber of ethical hacking candidates. The platform provides a credible overview of a professional's skills and ability when selecting the right hire.

      " My team and I used Professional Labs from Hack The Box to get used to the new trends of the Red Team concept. After a lot of positive frustration, dedication, and self-study we managed to finish the challenge and leave with much more knowledge than we had before. I strongly recommend this service to teams composed of dedicated persons, who love the technical aspects of penetration testing and also enjoy assisted self-study. ",

      " Our offensive security team was looking for a real-world training platform to test advanced attack tactics. We couldn’t be happier with the Professional Labs environment. The lab was fully dedicated, so we didn't share the environment with others. The HTB support team has been excellent to make the training fit our needs. ",

      " The best defense is a good offensive mindset. Hack The Box has enabled our security engineers a deeper understanding on how adversaries work in a real world environment. I provided a learn-at-your-own-pace training experience for my team and track progress towards agreed upon goals. Their knowledge of exploitation, privilege escalation, and system enumeration has grown exponentially since purchasing HTB. ",

      " As defenders, it would be a great mistake to think that offensive knowledge is not a must-have in our skillset. HTB Academy helps our team gain that knowledge at their own pace, by providing quality and easy-to-follow content. From the curious software engineer to our best analysts, custom learning paths allow us to build the best experience for every kind of security enthusiast. ",
